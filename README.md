# Alfred Snippets

For a long time I was using aText for inserting snippets into documents. Unfortunately, aText becomes more and more outdated. But: Alfred has great snippet support in version 3.

Here's my collection of Alfred 3 snippets and also a script to convert aText snippets to Alfred snippets.

## Conversion Script

`convert-aText-to-Alfred.py` will take an aText-exported `.csv` file and create a `.alfredsnippets` file from it.

The only non-standard Python package used is [*Click*](http://click.pocoo.org/), which is awesome.  
`pip install click` it!

The script is somewhat general, but mainly tailored to my needs. If you want to extend it, feel free to file a pull request or enhancement report.
